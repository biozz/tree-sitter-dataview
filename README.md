# tree-sitter-dataview

This is a [Tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io) grammar for [Obsidian DataView](https://blacksmithgu.github.io/obsidian-dataview) query language.

The goal of the project is to make it possible to use DataView inside NeoVim. This is a very ambitious goal and tree-sitter grammar is only a little part of it.

Tree-sitter grammar for DataView will provide:

- syntax highlighting in markdown blocks
- an abstraction layer for parsing, which can be used in JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C, Go, Rust, etc.

There is also `example` folder which contains an implementation of a ¬´DataView Playground¬ª. I call it playground, becuase I would like to run DataView queries in the browser and see the output, since there is no good way to display query results inside NeoVim.

## Current state

We are in a deep WIP state. Not much stuff is working. There is a lot to do in terms of compatibility.

Overall, there are 3 main topics:

- compatibility with the DataView DQL
- highlighting
- playground

## Compatibility

This is a work-in-progress project. Please see compatibility matrix below.
